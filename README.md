# iBucket_Landing_Page
This project showcases my skills in HTML and CSS, where I used advanced techniques in CSS like Grid System and FlexBox to make the website responsive on small and large screen sizes, and used semantic HTML so that it helps disabled people navigate the website seamlessly and for better Search Engine Optimization (SEO)
